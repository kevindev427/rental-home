I get there. The place was dusty. Prior to checking in. I asked for extra towels did not get it. Messaged the host and still didn\u2019t get it.

We were able to do laundry, cook, use the fridge, shower, and more without issue! The house is about 5 min walk from the nearest subway station, which is then only two stops to Shinjuku. There's a little market street around the corner and plenty of accessible food and convenience stores. Was happy with the stay and would stay again!",

The layout of the rooms was quite comfortable for my husband and our 19 yr old daughter. The neighborhood has many restaurants and cafes to suit everyone's tastes. The bus lines are convenient as well. We ended up renting a car for a couple days during the stay and didn't have any problem finding parking nearby.

Bed was comfy and space was larger than it looked in the pictures. Perfect for a work trip or a quick getaway. The hill up to the spot is super steep, so plan on taking lyfts, especially from the airport, if you have luggage. Liz lives above the studio, but studio feels super private. Great for walking down to Glen Park for crepes or beers or market shopping. Easy to get to Bart + the mission. Loved it.",

A little hiccups on parking space, but always expect that around bay area. My fiance and I decided to bring our own towels, bed sheets and covers because of this \"virus\" but when we see the room. We want to forget about what we brought. Place is virtually clean, spotless. View from the room is amazing. Part city lights, part garden. We went ahead and followed our original plan. To use our own and disinfect regardless. And oh, Victor's cable has 90 Days Fiance! Which is my fiance and I favorite TV show. That's a plus. Also, he is kind enough to put water and some snacks inside the room. The bathroom has floor heater and complete with body wash, shampoo and conditioner. And it wasn't generic. This place is highly recommended.",

Two adult guests were provided with one USED toilet paper roll (no replacements at all!), no tissues at all, one bath towel each, one hand towel, and one wash cloth to share for a 5 day stay!!! This is so unacceptable it\u2019s not even funny. The house was hard to find because the number on the house is wrong and the town is to be completely honest terrifying. There was a park next door where unsettling characters and drug addicts hung out at and there was no bolt lock on the door or screen in one of the windows. We felt so unsafe we didn\u2019t even want to open the windows at night and it was so hot in there because we weren\u2019t even provided a fan that we woke up drenched every morning. The description says that there would be disposable utensils provided and even though this was not completely untrue all they gave us was sporks and we had no knives at all. We had to go out and buy some at the store, we left the extras behind so future guests don\u2019t have to do the same. We were here when SF got shut down and had to buy groceries in order to eat and the mini fridge barely worked and all of our food got warm. Due to all of these reasons we even left a day and half early because we didn\u2019t want to be",

No shower or bath as shown, which led to many mornings washing my hair in the sink, but also allows (forces) you to get a more \"authentic\" experience by utilizing one of the nearby public baths. I greatly enjoyed the public bath and could do without a daily wash. All in all, this is a great place to sleep, store your luggage, and sometimes eat a takeout dinner in peace.

The place was clean and had everything we needed. It got a little warm during the days (thanks to the large windows and sunshine) but we were able to cool off with the included fan and curtains. It must be stated that this place is on the same block as Rich Table, where we had an all-time great meal. RT Rotisserie is around the corner as well and also had fantastic food. Hayes Valley is a very nice neighborhood with tons of good coffee, ice cream, restaurants and shops within a few blocks. We were also able to walk to The Castro, Mission, and Alamo Square, and Land\u2019s End and Chinatown were easy Lyfts away. Overall, this was a great space to stay, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to get to know the city.",

Rooms are located on 7 floors, on street or on our private courtyard, with nice windows, even in the bathroom, and some with double doors or shower cabine, or balcony. All are equipped with numerous electrical outlets, a modern telephone with hands-free and speaker, and a mini-fridge. The housekeeping is done daily, and the towels in the bathroom are changed. The hotel is ancient, its foundations are millennial, may be build at the time of the Roman Empire, when Paris was called Lutece : we are near the roman thermal baths of Cluny (Thermes). The ambiance is both, family and multicultural. Many artists, writers, musicians, authors and publishers, journalists, professors and academics, filmmakers, have always stayed there, but also entrepreneurs and start-upers, from all over the world. But the most important thing is not your room, it's the magnificent atmosphere of the neighborhood : the busy streets, rue de Seine and rue de Buci, are just under the hotel windows (witch have double glass).",
