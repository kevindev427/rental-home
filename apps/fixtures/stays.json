All are equipped with numerous electrical outlets, a modern telephone with hands-free and speaker, and a mini-fridge. The housekeeping is done daily, and the towels in the bathroom are changed. The hotel is ancient, its foundations are millennial, may be build at the time of the Roman Empire, when Paris was called Lutece : we are near the roman thermal baths of Cluny (Thermes). The ambiance is both, family and multicultural. Many artists, writers, musicians, authors and publishers, journalists, professors and academics, filmmakers, have always stayed there, but also entrepreneurs and start-upers, from all over the world. But the most important thing is not your room, it's the magnificent atmosphere of the neighborhood : the busy streets, rue de Seine and rue de Buci, are just under the hotel windows (witch have double glass).",
