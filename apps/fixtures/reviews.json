Big windows let in lots of light, with no neighbors looking in. Bed was comfy and space was larger than it looked in the pictures. Perfect for a work trip or a quick getaway.

Two adult guests were provided with one USED toilet paper roll (no replacements at all!), no tissues at all, one bath towel each, one hand towel, and one wash cloth to share for a 5 day stay!!! This is so unacceptable it\u2019s not even funny. The house was hard to find because the number on the house is wrong and the town is to be completely honest terrifying. There was a park next door where unsettling characters and drug addicts hung out at and there was no bolt lock on the door or screen in one of the windows. We felt so unsafe we didn\u2019t even want to open the windows at night and it was so hot in there because we weren\u2019t even provided a fan that we woke up drenched every morning. The description says that there would be disposable utensils provided and even though this was not completely untrue all they gave us was sporks and we had no knives at all. We had to go out and buy some at the store, we left the extras behind so future guests don\u2019t have to do the same. We were here when SF got shut down and had to buy groceries in order to eat and the mini fridge barely worked and all of our food got warm.
